This directory contains some examples of services based on
the SeeAlso-Module. You can directly use them if SeeAlso is
installed in your PERL library path (@INC) or if the 'lib'
directory of SeeAlso is a subdirectory of the examples. On
Unix just create a symlink with "ln -s ../lib/ lib".

The examples are

cgi-test.pl

download-thingISBN.sh

extract-thingISBN.pl
